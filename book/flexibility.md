- How do you ensure what you've built is capable of handling those
  moving goals?
- When you need to cut a corner, how do you do it in such a way that you
  don't paint yourself into a corner? How do you make sure the cut
  corner wasn't important? How do you fill it in later?
- DRY. The more cruft you have the less flexible you are to change.
- Use the right abstractions/common vocabularies, such that changes are
  as minor as possible.
